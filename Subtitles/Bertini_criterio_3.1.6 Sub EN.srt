1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,880
Documentation of criterion 3 1 6.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,800
The pronunciation.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Criterion 3 1 6 or rather the
pronunciation criterion consists in making

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,600
available a mechanism to identify
specific pronunciations for words whose

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,720
meaning in context is ambiguous if
its pronunciation is not known.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,000
The intent of this success criterion is

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,360
to help visually impaired people
and people with vision problems

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,320
with reading difficulties in
understanding the contents.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,640
In cases whose meaning often depends on

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,080
the pronunciation of
words or characters that

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,240
have different meanings, each
with its own pronunciation.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,280
This success criterion can help the

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,280
people who have difficulty
decoding words or context

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,160
but also those who use
programs for reading aloud.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,320
Some examples of this criterion can
be given by reading the name of an

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,360
person show the reading of the words
provide an audio file of the pronunciation

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,120
include pronunciation
information using a glossary

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
or a text that includes information about
the pronunciation of characters shared by

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,080
several languages but pronounced
differently in each language.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,760
The applications of the criterion are

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,800
I'll just show you a few of them today.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,280
The first method I want to show you is

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,840
provide the pronunciation
immediately after the word.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,760
This method consists, as the
title suggests, of inserting

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,080
immediately after the word is pronounced.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,960
This will result in a second reading
by the voice synthesizers which will

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,600
will read the first word incorrectly
and the second word correctly.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,160
The second method I will show you
will be to insert a link inside the

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,960
of the word that you connect to an
audio or pronunciation dictionary.

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,440
The third method I want to
show you is the glossary.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,560
The objective of this technique is to make

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,840
available the definitions of the word
short phrase by providing the definition

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,760
in a glossary. A glossary that
is an alphabetical list of

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
words phrases and abbreviations with their

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,400
definitions. Glossaries
are more appropriate

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,240
when the words, phrases and
abbreviations used within the

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,960
content refer to a specific
discipline or technological area.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,960
A glossary may also provide the
pronunciation of a word or phrase.

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,680
Furthermore, this method is closely
linked to criterion 3 1 3 and 3 1 4.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,160
Which the 3 1 4

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,720
is that of abbreviations was 3
1 3 is that of unusual words.

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,120
The fourth and last method I will show you

43
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,520
is the use of standard diacritical
marks that can be deactivated.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,520
The objective of this
technique is to provide

45
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,840
users a mechanism to activate and
deactivate diacritical marks.

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Many languages use signs and signs

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,800
diacritics to indicate the pronunciation
of words or to help distinguish them.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Some languages may use signs

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,000
diacritics to indicate vowels to
indicate doubling of consonants

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,600
indicate the absence of a vowel or
consonant or for other purposes.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,760
Although it is possible to read the texts

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,920
without such diacritical
signs the addition of

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,680
diacritical signs can improve readability.

54
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Thank you for watching the video.

55
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,520
They left a time lapse of
the latest modifications.
